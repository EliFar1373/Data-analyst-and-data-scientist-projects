NLP Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

Sentiment analysis means:
👉 Using NLP to classify text (reviews) as Positive / Negative / Neutral.

This is one of the most common NLP tasks, especially for movie reviews (IMDB, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon).

🧠 Why Sentiment Analysis Matters

For a movie ML project, it can help you:

✅Predict if audiences liked the movie
✅ Compare critics vs audience sentiment
✅ Improve revenue / rating prediction
✅ Extract emotional signals from reviews
✅ Do trend analysis over time

📝 What Data You Need

You need a dataset containing:

column	example
review_text	“This movie was fantastic! The visuals were stunning!”
sentiment	positive / negative / neutral

If your dataset does not include labeled sentiments, you can:

✔ Use a pretrained model to label them (weak labeling)
✔ Or manually label some (small dataset)

Popular datasets (free):

IMDB Reviews Dataset (50,000 labeled reviews)

Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review Dataset

Sentiment140 (Twitter dataset)

🧰 How Sentiment Analysis Works (High Level)
1. Preprocessing

Lowercase

Remove punctuation

Remove stopwords

Tokenize

Optionally use lemmatization

2. Feature Extraction

Two main approaches:

A. Traditional (TF–IDF)

Convert text → TF-IDF vectors
Then train:

Logistic Regression

SVM

Naive Bayes

Good for small projects.

B. Modern (Transformer Models)

Use pretrained deep learning models:

BERT

DistilBERT

RoBERTa

GPT-style embeddings (not generative)

These models understand context and perform far better.
